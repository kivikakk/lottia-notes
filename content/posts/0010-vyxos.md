  Nix configuration revealed!

<section id="top">

Just a little note to say that I've published [VyxOS], my Nix configuration.

It's just over a year old at this point, and at one point supported a large mesh
of eccentric servers with its own dynamic mesh and DNS and all sorts of
nonsense, but the config and infra has been hugely condensed to make it friendly
to my brain, and the history scrubbed to make it friendly to publishing.

Hope it's interesting!
